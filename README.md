# breadbot
This is a chatbotthat knows everything about making bread

This is based on ChatGPT's Open AI API repository, I made a few edits in the "Insert Prompt" section which is what changes the chatbot's expertise. The programming is so advanced that all you need to do is copy and paste the code into some directory where you want to run the program, then change the prompt to your liking. Run they program by typing python3 breadbot.py and get to chatting!
